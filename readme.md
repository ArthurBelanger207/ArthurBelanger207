## 🪖 Code Warrior. Combat Veteran. Builder of Second Chances.

I served with the 5th Special Forces Group from 1999–2003 — boots on the ground in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  
Earned tabs from SAPPER School, Pathfinder, Ranger Leadership, and survived the SERE Level C crucible.  
Came home broken, lost a friend, nearly lost myself. Then I found purpose in code.

**No handouts. No shortcuts. One mission: Build tools that matter.**

  → From template junk to handcrafted digital presence

## 🧠 From the Inside Out

> In 2023, after 22-years into a prison sentence with zero tech background.  
> No laptop experience. No GitHub. No roadmap. Just fire.

- Taught myself full-stack dev in isolation — Flask, JS, Jinja, CLI scripting  
- Earned certifications from **Google**, **UC Davis**, **University of Michigan**  
- Went from student to TA — teaching others to build the same way I did  
- Now I build software that runs offline, under pressure, and without excuses  

---

## ⚔️ My Ethos

- **Code like your life depends on it.**  
- **No fluff. No gimmicks. Just raw function and impact.**  
- **If it doesn’t run offline, it’s not ready for the real world.**  
- **Accessibility > Aesthetics. Clarity > Cleverness.**

## 🛠 Dev Arsenal

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bash, Batch  
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap  
- **Tools**: Visual Studio (custom extensions), BrowserSync, PyInstaller  
- **Environments**: Locked down, air-gapped, firewalled — *I get it working anyway*
